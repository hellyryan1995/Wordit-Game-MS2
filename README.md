# WordIt Memory Game

Word-It is an interactive memory game inspired by the classic game [Bopit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bop_It)  
The user will have to select the word given as quickly as possible before the timer runs out, 
the further you get on in the games the time you have to select the correct word decreases.

## UX

Word-It is based around one of my favourite childhood games Bopit, there was something so satisfying about acting out the commands given
by the game as quick as you can whilst the pace of the game got quicker and quicker the higher up your score went.

That's what I went for with Word-It but with an added Twist, instead of following the Bopit commands, twist it, bop it, pull it and flick it  
I went for Red, Green, Blue and Yellow but the catch is the background colour doesn’t match with the word.

The game was designed for the user who wants to experience a version with the fundamentals of Bopit with the added extras which makes it more 
practical and effective whilst being played on Desktop, Tablet & Mobile.
