# WordIt Memory Game

Word-It is an interactive memory game inspired by the classic game [Bopit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bop_It)  
The user will have to select the word given as quickly as possible before the timer runs out, 
the further you get on in the games the time you have to select the correct word decreases.

## UX

Word-It is based around one of my favourite childhood games Bopit, there was something so satisfying about acting out the commands given
by the game as quick as you can whilst the pace of the game got quicker and quicker the higher up your score went.

That's what I went for with Word-It but with an added Twist, instead of following the Bopit commands, twist it, bop it, pull it and flick it  
I went for Red, Green, Blue and Yellow but the catch is the background colour doesn’t match with the word.

The game was designed for the user who wants to experience a version with the fundamentals of Bopit with the added extras which makes it more 
practical and effective whilst being played on Desktop, Tablet & Mobile.

### Design Choices

**Fonts**

* The font im using through is called [Heebo,](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Heebo?preview.text_type=custom) 
within this font I will being using two styles through out the game, 800 & 200

**Colours**

For the background I went for an of shade of black as it allows user to easily focus on one thing at a time compared to a light background.

Colour used: #181818

Titles: #ffffff

Paragprahs & outlines: #B2B2B2

The buttons are made of four vibrant colour choices which are:
* Red - #FC0050
* Blue - #28CDFF
* Green - #00E384
* Yellow - #FFBA19

They are all chosen as with a purpose to be the main focus within the game.

### How to Play

Once you click start and you will have to click the button that corresponds with the WORD display in the centre of the screen, 
you are following the word and not the background colour of the button, the time between each command will reduce and you progress 
into the forcing you to speed up on selecting the correct command. 

The player may also use the key commands displayed on the screen.

## Features

### Existing Features
